AN INDIGENOUS DOMESTIC WORKER’S JOURNEY INSPIRES THIS INTIMATE YET UNIVERSAL PORTRAIT OF FAMILY, MEMORY AND LOVE. IN ROMA, OSCAR WINNER ALFONSO CUARÓN DELIVERS A VIVID, EMOTIONAL PORTRAIT OF A DOMESTIC WORKER, CLEO, WHICH ASKS US TO EXPLORE HOW WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE WOMEN WHO CARE FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR HOMES: THE REAL-LIFE CLEOS EVERYWHERE.
2.5 million Domestic workers in the United States
70% are paid less than $13/Hr
65% Have no health insurance
DOMESTIC WORKERS ARE THE UNSUNG HEROINES OF OUR CHILDHOODS AND FAMILIES. THEY ARE NANNIES, HOUSE CLEANERS, AND CARE WORKERS — MOSTLY WOMEN OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS. DESPITE THEIR IMPORTANT ROLES, THEIR WORK OFTEN GOES UNRECOGNIZED AND THEIR INDUSTRY UNREGULATED. TAKE ACTION AND HELP US SHIFT THE NARRATIVE.
YOU CAN HELP IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR DOMESTIC WORKERS.
